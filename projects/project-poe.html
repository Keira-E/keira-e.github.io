                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This system provides a standards-compliant IEEE 802.3bt Power over Ethernet (PoE) backbone for distributed edge AI deployments.
                    It localizes high-voltage AC/DC conversion at an accessible location and fans out multiple high-power PoE channels that can safely
                    deliver power and data over 100 m of cable to AI compute nodes installed in harsh or inaccessible environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I owned the full technical lifecycle: standards review, requirements definition, PoE architecture, PCB design, embedded supervisory
                    implementation, and test planning. The design emphasizes safety, maintainability, and field-debuggability so that non-specialist
                    technicians can deploy and manage complex AI hardware without modifying mains wiring.
                </p>

                <h2>System Architecture & Design Decisions</h2>
                <p>
                    The core of the system is a high-power PoE Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) fed from a 54 V AC/DC supply. Each port negotiates its power
                    budget with a downstream Powered Device (PD) via IEEE 802.3bt classification before enabling power delivery. The architecture was chosen
                    to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep mains voltage confined to a single, controlled enclosure.</li>
                    <li>Provide scalable, multi-port power distribution to remote AI compute nodes.</li>
                    <li>Support long cable runs while preserving power integrity and safety margins.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A Raspberry Pi supervisory controller monitors PSE status over a management interface and exposes per-port controls (enable/disable,
                    reset, power budget monitoring). I implemented a lightweight Python + MQTT stack so operators can remotely cycle power to individual AI
                    nodes, retrieve fault data, and integrate status into higher-level observability systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An important design challenge was attaching non-PoE local peripherals (such as additional sensing or control boards) to the 54 V rail
                    feeding the PSE without disturbing the PSE’s signature and classification process. I resolved this by isolating these peripherals behind
                    an optocoupler-controlled 12 V rail that only connects after PoE negotiation is complete, preserving the correct impedance profile at
                    startup.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Verification & Research Angle</h2>
                <p>
                    I designed a test harness that emulates multiple PDs with configurable class signatures and load profiles so that the PSE’s negotiation,
                    fault behavior, and thermal performance could be characterized without relying on final AI hardware. This allowed structured experiments
                    on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Behavior under marginal cable conditions (length, gauge, and fault injection).</li>
                    <li>Transient response when repeatedly cycling high-power ports.</li>
                    <li>Corner cases in multi-port power budgeting and overload protection.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The project provides a platform for future research on resilient power delivery for distributed AI systems, including adaptive power
                    budgeting, condition-based maintenance using telemetry, and integration with higher-level orchestration of compute resources.
                </p>
