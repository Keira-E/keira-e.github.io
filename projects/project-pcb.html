                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This custom power controller is the primary electronics platform for an underwater computer vision system that monitors fish behavior.
                    It receives high-voltage DC over long cable runs, generates regulated rails for an edge AI compute module, and drives high-power
                    illumination LEDs with tightly controlled timing and current profiles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I owned the end-to-end design: requirements capture, power architecture, schematics and layout in KiCad, firmware for the STM32
                    microcontroller, and structured verification including EMI and thermal characterization.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Power Architecture & LED Control</h2>
                <p>
                    To meet both power and signal integrity constraints over 100 m of cabling, the system uses a high-voltage input rail feeding several
                    cascaded DC-DC stages:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>High-voltage input rail &rarr; intermediate 12 V rail for compute and auxiliary electronics.</li>
                    <li>Dedicated LED rails driving constant-current LED driver ICs for high-intensity illumination.</li>
                    <li>Low-voltage logic rail for the STM32 and digital interfaces.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The STM32 supervises system power states, monitors fault conditions, and generates LED control signals via a parallel SPI interface to
                    multiple LED driver channels. This enables precise control of brightness and timing in synchronization with the AI compute pipeline.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Robustness, EMI, and Field Diagnostics</h2>
                <p>
                    The PCB layout and component selection were guided by EMI, thermal, and maintainability constraints. Key decisions include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Segregated high-current and low-noise regions with controlled return paths.</li>
                    <li>Use of solid-state switching elements and e-fusing for protection and reliability.</li>
                    <li>Careful placement of bulk and local decoupling to handle long cable transients.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    On-board diagnostic LEDs and test points were added to support rapid field troubleshooting, allowing technicians to quickly determine
                    whether issues originate in power distribution, LED channels, or communications.
                </p>
