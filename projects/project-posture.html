                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This project explored how low-cost magnetic sensing can be used to monitor seated posture without intrusive hardware on the user.
                    The system embeds Hall-effect sensors beneath a foam seat and uses changes in magnetic field strength as a proxy for pressure distribution.
                    When the user slouches or shifts into a poor posture state, the device generates an alert to encourage correction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My primary contribution was the design and implementation of a compact analog switching and measurement subsystem that allows a single
                    microcontroller to interrogate multiple Hall-effect sensors while maintaining adequate resolution and response time.
                </p>

                <h2>Sensing Architecture & Analog Design</h2>
                <p>
                    The seat contains an array of magnets and Hall-effect sensors arranged so that vertical displacement and load changes map onto measurable
                    differences in sensor output. I designed an analog multiplexing network that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sequentially connects individual Hall-effect sensors to a shared ADC input.</li>
                    <li>Maintains signal integrity across channels using appropriate source impedance and filtering.</li>
                    <li>Fits within the voltage and current constraints of the chosen microcontroller.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Care was taken to ensure that the sensor outputs remained within a linear operating region and that crosstalk between channels was
                    minimized. This enabled the microcontroller to reconstruct a coarse “pressure map” of the seat using only a handful of analog resources.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Embedded Processing & Feedback</h2>
                <p>
                    On the firmware side, the microcontroller cycles through the sensor array, digitizes readings, and computes posture metrics based on
                    relative loading across regions (e.g., forward lean, lateral tilt, and slouching). Thresholds and simple heuristics are used to determine
                    whether the user is within an acceptable posture envelope.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The device provides immediate feedback through LEDs and audio cues, closing the loop between sensing and behavior. This architecture
                    could be extended with more advanced algorithms or machine learning models to classify posture states more precisely.
                </p>
